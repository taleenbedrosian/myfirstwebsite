  <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Taleen Bedrosian. I am a software engineer. The skills and knowledge that I’ve gained while studying Computer Engineering Technology and Software Engineering Technology, through the diversity of my work experience makes me an excellent and hard working individual.</p>
<p> My 8 years of work experience in customer service has given me many interpersonal skills. Which has taught me a great deal of different types of customers and how to problem solve. In many of my workplaces my manager’s often complemented me for how much effort I put into the company. Often saying that I treated it as my own. As well as my close to 2 years of experience in IT. I learned a great deal of troubleshooting, multitasking, and keeping myself organized.</p>
<p> Within my role of IT, I learned a great deal when it comes to onboarding new employees and their profile set ups, updating passwords, granting access to mailboxes and distribution lists, implementing software on a workstation and so much more. </p>
